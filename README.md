# Rules

Provider-neutral Liberu Automation module for **typed conditions, expressions, validation, simulation, decision tables**.

The core package owns domain state, validation, persistence, policies, and lifecycle events. API, Filament, and Livewire adapters are optional one-to-one packages and contain no domain rules.

## Compatibility

PHP 8.5 · Laravel 13 · Composer 2 · Pest 5

## Installation

```bash
composer require liberusoftware/automation-rules
php artisan migrate
```

The module uses explicit team context and idempotency keys. Disabling it never deletes its data.
